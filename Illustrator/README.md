# Adobe Illustrator AHK Automation

## Overview

This is a collection of [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (v2) scripts that help optimize my workflow in Adobe Illustrator. This repo is in its very early stages.

I will be adding and updating this repo as I develop more scripts. Everything is being tested on the latest version of Adobe Illustrator CC 2023 but many scripts will be backwards compatible.
